Panicmode Kernel Module
=======================

This Linux kernel module aims at implementing a simple on-request memory wiper.
It is supposed to copy it's own code to a known physical location in memory, disable
all of the linux kernel stuff, that may interfere with the wipe and then wipe the 
whole physical memory except itself. 

This kernel module can be especially useful in combination with a hardware trigger
device.


how to build:
$ KERNELDIR=/usr/src/linux-2.6 make -C /usr/src/linux-2.6/ M=`pwd` modules

usage:
# echo 1 > /proc/panicmode
